# PhotoPage

The PhotoPage source code, preserved on GitHub for historical interest. For releases, see the App Center link.

As this was converted from TFVC to Git on Azure DevOps, only the last 180 days of commits were able to be migrated to this repo. Commit author information was updated through a Git Bash script.

Please keep in mind that this is old software which is no longer maintained by me. Consider any bugs and spaghetti code a product of its time.
